# Events

- there are several key events

1. keydown occurs when we touch(push) the key and hold it
2. when we leaves the key, it will fire keyup event
3. keypress is something, it occures when content change.

- We can also add event to many elements, for that we need to create div or any element and add even by using any kind a loop.

- We also have "input" (also change) event, which triggers when anything in input value changes.
