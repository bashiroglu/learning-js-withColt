Arrow functions are another kind of function defining methods.

```
const double = (num) => {
  return num * 2;
};
```

if we have one param we can leave ()

```
const double = num => {
  return num * 2;
};
```

if we return signle line, we can also leave {} block. This is called implicit return.

```
const double = num => num * 2;
```
